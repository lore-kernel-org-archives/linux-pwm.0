That will work only for very long periods. I did test where value captured
into TCAR was compared to value read from TCRR. Sometimes those differ by
few hundreds microseconds...

I started this work to overcome GPIO edge interrupts latency, but so far
I'm a bit dissapointed.

(also please read the code, reconfiguration is done to get period and
duty cycle - but in case of duty cycle it is not clear whenever we are
measuring pulse or space length)
