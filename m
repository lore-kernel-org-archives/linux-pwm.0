Subject: [PATCH v2 3/4] pwm: Update DT bindings to reference pwm.txt for cells documentation
Date: Thu, 18 Jul 2013 00:54:23 +0200

The PWM client cells format is documented in the generic pwm.txt
documentation and duplicated in all PWM driver bindings. Remove
duplicate information and reference pwm.txt instead.
