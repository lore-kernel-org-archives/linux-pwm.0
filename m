All that register access would happen only in drivers/clocksource/timer-dm.c?
So platform data will hold all function pointers needed for event capture
and the pwm driver will do only interface to pwm framework.

I do not follow. Each general-purpose timer module has its own interrupt line,
so claiming that irq directly using request_irq seems enough. Could you
explain interrupt controller idea a bit more?
