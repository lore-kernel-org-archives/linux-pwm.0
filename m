It largely depends on what we consider as system flags. We should probably be 
talking about common flags instead of system flags. I usually try to 
standardize DT properties that are common to multiple devices. Some of those 
properties can apply to all devices of the same class (possibly 
implemented/emulated in software when the hardware doesn't support them), but 
others are just commonly seen properties that don't make sense for all the 
devices.

One example I'm familiar with can be found in V4L2 DT bindings. We've 
standardized properties to specify what kind of video synchronization signals 
devices support/use. Not all synchronization signals are supported by a given 
video transmitter, so DT bindings for such chips list (or at least should 
list) the common properties supported by a given device. The definitions of 
the properties should of course not be duplicated to all individual DT 
bindings.

Exactly. That's why I think listing the supported common flags in individual 
bindings makes sense when some of the flags are not supported by all devices. 
As the only PWM flags currently used are common to all PWM devices I can leave 
this out now. I have no strong preference, I'll follow your opinion on this.
