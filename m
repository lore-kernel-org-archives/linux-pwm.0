Shouldn't the addition of include/dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h be separate from
its inclusion in include/linux/pwm.h so that it can be moved more easily
(cherry-picked) to a separate repository?

I think I've seen stuff like the following done in a few header files to
keep compatibility between enums and defines.

	enum foo {
		BAR,
	#define BAR BAR
		BAZ,
	#define BAZ BAZ
	};

Which, as I understand it, won't work in this case because DTC can only
cope with plain cpp files?

I'm not quite sure what exactly you are suggesting here. Can you
elaborate?
