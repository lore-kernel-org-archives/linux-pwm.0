It's not whether they have their own unique clock, but whether the 
submodules have OCP integration registers, speak the idle/standby 
protocols, have direct L3/L4 ports, etc.

I don't know if that should be done or not.  I haven't stared at the code 
yet, but based on your description, it sounds to me that it probably 
shouldn't be done.  In any case, it's not what I meant...

What I meant is that the ECAP*, EQEP*, EHRPWM* devices don't need to be 
registered through the hwmod code, due to the fact that they don't have 
the integration mentioned above.  Instead, I think those three subdevices 
should be listed as child nodes of epwmss* in the DT.

Looking at the DT data from Vignesh, it looks like he's already got 
ehrpwm1 as a child node of the epwmss1:

+               epwmss1: epwmss@48440000 {
+                       compatible = "ti,dra7xx-pwmss", "ti,am33xx-pwmss";
+                       reg = <0x48440000 0x30>;
+                       ti,hwmods = "epwmss1";
+                       #address-cells = <1>;
+                       #size-cells = <1>;
+                       status = "disabled";
+                       ranges = <0x48440100  0x48440100  0x80   /* ECAP */
+                                 0x48440180  0x48440180  0x80   /* EQEP */
+                                 0x48440200  0x48440200  0x80>; /* EHRPWM */
+
+                       ehrpwm1: ehrpwm@48440200 {
+                               compatible = "ti,dra7xx-ehrpwm",
+                                            "ti,am33xx-ehrpwm";
+                               #pwm-cells = <3>;
+                               reg = <0x48440200 0x80>;
+                               ti,hwmods = "ehrpwm1";

So, drop the above line, since the subdevices don't have corresponding 
hwmods any more.

+                               status = "disabled";
+                       };

Then, here, you'd add nodes similar to ehrpwm1 for ecap1 and eqep1.  I 
can't remember at the moment if adding "simple-bus" to the epwmss1 string 
would be sufficient to register the subdevices after the epwmss1 is 
probed.  If so, maybe that's all you need.

+               };

Then repeat for epwmss0, epwmss2.
