Hmm what do you mean? We don't want to export tons of custom functions from
the timers in and then be in trouble when at some point we have a Linux
generic hw timer framework. We already had to deal with these custom
exports earlier with conversion to multiarch and then again with
device tree.

For now, it's best to pass the timer information to the pwm driver in
platform data. In the long run that will be much easier to deal with than
fixing random drivers tinkering with the timer registers directly.

Ideally the pwm driver would just do a request_irq from the dmtimer code
where dmtimer code would implement an interrupt controller. That would
be already most fo the Linux generic hardware timer framework right there :)
