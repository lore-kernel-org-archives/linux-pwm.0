But even if it was the driver should handle ioremap() returning NULL gracefully and abort the driver probe. That said you'll probably not run a kernel that was built with COMPILE_TEST on your real hardware since it contains so many drivers that are completely useless on your hardware. The idea of COMPILE_TEST is to have as much compile test exposure as possible to the code that is enabled by COMPILE_TEST. Stubbing out ioremap() and friends when HAS_IOMEM is not set and COMPILE_TEST is set makes it easier to get there.

For me, welcome Greg's idea or suggestion for it.
