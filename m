I'd prefer for the original text to stay in place and the reference to
the dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h file to go below that block. The reason is
that perhaps somebody will look at an older version of a given DT (with
the numerical value) and not have access to the include and therefore
not know which flag was being set by just looking at the documentation.
I'm also not sure about what the plans are with respect to shipping
device trees in a separate repository and if they are, whether that
repository would ship the includes as well.

Another issue might be that people without access to recent versions of
DTC won't be able to use the new #include feature, so keeping the
documentation backwards compatible seems like a good idea.

Perhaps the include file should even only be mentioned in the general
PWM binding documentation.

Perhaps Grant and Rob (Cc'ed) can comment on how they want to handle
this.

This part mixes spaces and tabs for indentation. Please stick to spaces.

You'd have a hard time finding those in the GPIO header. =3D)

I think this should go into a patch separate from the DT changes above
because they'll likely go in via different trees. Or maybe they won't,
but it'd still be good to introduce the header first and only then
change the DTS files.

That's what the enum values will be by default, so there's no need to be
explicit here.
