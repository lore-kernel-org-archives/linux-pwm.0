Hi Felipe,

this is nice and interesting technology!

I am quoting the whole mail over to linux-pwm and Thierry
as well as  linux-iio and Jon Cameron for consideration. My comments
at the end.

So the first thing: periodic assetion of a GPIO, sounds awfully lot
like PWM does it not? I guess the output is a square wave?

While it is possible to model things like this as pin config, have you
considered just adding a PWM interface and present it to the kernel
as a PWM (possibly with a separate resource, in DT we use &phandle
but in ACPI I guess you Intel people have something else for PWM)?
If need be we can ask the ACPI people.

For the other thing: timestamping of GPIO events, we already
support timestamps for userspace GPIOs, but all it does is use
the kernel time, see gpiolib.c:

static irqreturn_t lineevent_irq_thread(int irq, void *p)
{
        struct lineevent_state *le = p;
        struct gpioevent_data ge;
        int ret, level;

        ge.timestamp = ktime_get_real_ns();
        level = gpiod_get_value_cansleep(le->desc);

        if (le->eflags & GPIOEVENT_REQUEST_RISING_EDGE
            && le->eflags & GPIOEVENT_REQUEST_FALLING_EDGE) {
                if (level)
                        /* Emit low-to-high event */
                        ge.id = GPIOEVENT_EVENT_RISING_EDGE;
                else
                        /* Emit high-to-low event */
                        ge.id = GPIOEVENT_EVENT_FALLING_EDGE;
        } else if (le->eflags & GPIOEVENT_REQUEST_RISING_EDGE && level) {
                /* Emit low-to-high event */
                ge.id = GPIOEVENT_EVENT_RISING_EDGE;
        } else if (le->eflags & GPIOEVENT_REQUEST_FALLING_EDGE && !level) {
                /* Emit high-to-low event */
                ge.id = GPIOEVENT_EVENT_FALLING_EDGE;
        } else {
                return IRQ_NONE;
        }

        ret = kfifo_put(&le->events, ge);
        if (ret != 0)
                wake_up_poll(&le->wait, POLLIN);

        return IRQ_HANDLED;
}

IIO already has a variety of timestamps to use, see
drivers/iio/industrialio-event.c.

What is on my TODO is to unify GPIO event timestamping with that
of IIO.

If there is further a *hardware* timestamp, that would be yet another
alternative timestamp, so we should first extend to use the different
timestamps supported by IIO and then add "hardware-native"
timestamping to the mix IMO. Unless there are other ideas.

Lars-Peter Clausen may have a better idea of what to do here, he
has run a few complex use cases like GNUradio (IIRC) using
timestamping. Also I think sensorfusion-type scenarios use these
timestamps quite a lot.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
