Yes that's what at least dw_apb_timer and sh_timer are doing.

Did not look beyond the dmtimer stuff, but let's start by moving dmtimer.c to
live under drivers and move the header, then do the pwm patches.

If there's a bug with the omap_dm_timer_set_load(), then naturally that
should be done separately as a fix before anything.
