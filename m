Hi Thierry,

I better see your point now. Regmap is already handling clock for
register access. I'll try to re-arrange things a little, so it's easier
to read and comment about enable/disable clock to PWM counter.

Thanks for these hints, I'll try to follow your advise on this:
- use get_state()
- call clk_enable() if PWM is already enabled.

Ok, I'll move it before or after register accesses sequence.

You're right. I'll remove this as well.
