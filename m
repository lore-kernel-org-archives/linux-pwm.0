I guess, we are just discussing about them in another threads, so I skip
them. If it is still necessary to reply (e.g. I misunderstand), please
let me know, thanks.

For me, welcome the score related maintainers' idea and suggestions.

When I am performing uml, I will try and also communicate with the
related maintainers for it (their suggestions and ideas are valuable).

Thanks.
