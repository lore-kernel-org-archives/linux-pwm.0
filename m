As I read this, the complexities of quadrature counting aren't covered...
The reason it works and can tell direction is down to order of state
transitions across the two channels.  So how do we describe that?  It's not
even the case that a particular existing state is relevant, there is
a temporal element (basically the state machine).
http://www.edn.com/design/integrated-circuit-design/4363949/Decode-a-quadrature-encoder-in-software
is a good description of the algorithm...

Now if we had some concept of composite signal lines, so a quadrature
pair was treated as one entity then that might work - but we still aren't
dealing with edges as such, but rather the state machine change
they represent.

Agreed the counter interface shouldn't be particularly tied to
quadrature type signals, but those are one of the most common
types so we do need to make sure we handle them cleanly.

All the other common counter types are more straight forward.
