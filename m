Hi William / al,

So the question is how to move this forwards?  I'm happy with how it turned
out and the existing drivers we had in IIO are a lot cleaner under
the counter subsystem (other than the backwards compatibility for those that
ever existed in IIO).  For those  not following closely the situation is:

1. Counter drivers never really fitted that well in IIO, because IIO is
focused on an abstraction of individual channels that just doesn't match
to these devices.  It's just the wrong model. 

2. William tried hard in earlier proposals to extend IIO to support these
devices well, but it became so convoluted and involved I advised him that
we were better off with a separate subsystem.  The amount of code overlap
between the core IIO support for counters and the reset of IIO was
become very small and it would have been a maintenance problem for both.
https://lwn.net/Articles/729363/ gives some of the history

3. The new subsystem introduced by this series is fairly simple, clean
and well aligned with the way these devices work. There are (I think)
4 initial drivers in this series from 4 different authors so it's got
some practical review that way!
There are a couple more drivers under development.  Right now, not
everyone is aware of this work and so we have had a few developers potentially
waste their time writing IIO drivers (which are then ported to this) rather
that starting with the counter subsystem.

So what we are after is more review, or agreement that we can move this
series forwards.  For now the intent is that the counter subsystem will
share the linux-iio mailing list etc but I don't think either William
or I have any particularly strong views on how we actually handle the
patches.  I'm more than happy to take them through the IIO tree, if that
works for everyone, particularly Greg as IIO goes through him after me.
Once it is in a release, the cross dependency is broken and we can think
about longer term approaches.

So Greg and others, how do we make progress here?  If there are any obvious
reviewers not on the CC list, please do draw their attention to this.

Thanks,

Jonathan

+CC linux-api as obviously one of the biggest areas for review is the new
userspace ABI.
