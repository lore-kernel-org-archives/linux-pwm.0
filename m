Yes, generally I'd prefer a separate, chip-specific debugfs file for
extra information. To be honest I'm not entirely sure of the usefulness
of the pwm_dbg_show() or letting drivers override it. But that's
slightly off-topic. However...

=2E.. I think perhaps a better way yet would be to have drivers update the
period and duty cycle to the actual values. That way there won't be a
delta between what's really being programmed to hardware and what shows
up in sysfs. It would also give users a chance to check if what's been
programmed is within an acceptable range or not.
