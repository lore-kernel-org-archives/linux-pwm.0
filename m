Thanks for the feedback.

The problem with pinctrl and PWM, is that the pinctrl API works by 
"states".
A default state, sleep state, and basically any custom state that the 
devicetree
provides. This works well until you need to control individually each 
pin; with
8 pins, you would need 2^8 states, each one corresponding to a given 
configuration.
