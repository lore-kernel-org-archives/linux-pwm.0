Hi Thierry,

This clock is used to generate PWM (source for LP timer counter). I
enable it here as:
- required state is 'enabled'
- current state is 'disabled'.
PWM is being turned on: first enable clock, then configure & enable PWM
bellow.

The opposite is done earlier, at the beginning of this routine:
- required state is 'disabled'
- current state is 'enabled'
PWM is turned off, then clock is disabled.

Enable count should be balanced, and clock is enabled when required
(e.g. when PWM is 'on'). Doing it unconditionally here may cause
unbalanced enable count (e.g. any duty_cycle update would increase
enable count)
Is it ok to keep this ?

clk_get() and clk_prepare() happens in regmap layer, when probing mfd part:
-> stm32_lptimer_probe()
  -> devm_regmap_init_mmio_clk()
    -> __devm_regmap_init_mmio_clk()
      -> regmap_mmio_gen_context()

Ho, you're right: thanks for pointing this!
I did some test on wavepol, but noticed nothing wrong on PWM signals.
I guess I was lucky! I'll fix it in v3.

In case of prescaler or polarity change, CFGR register needs to be
updated. CFGR register must be modified only when LP timer HW is disabled.
- Initial choice is to use this flag, to temporarily disable HW, update
cfgr, then re-enable it. More thinking about this...

- Another choice could be to refuse such a 'live' change and report
(busy?) error ? Then user would have to explicitly disable it, configure
new setting and re-enable it.

Please let me know your opinion.

If I keep current 'reenable' approach (CFGR update), I'll adopt your
proposal to simplify this. Or, maybe this can be dropped (e.g. report
busy error above ?).

This is necessary to balance earlier clk_enable() in case of error.

Ok, I'll have a look at it.

Bad dt configuration can trigger this error: thinking of a
'st,stm32-pwm-lp' dt node without proper mfd parent. Do you want me to
drop this ?
(or add comment about it ?)

You're right, I think I can simply drop this. (I kept this check from
pwm-stm32. Then I guess pmw-stm32 could be fixed as well.)

Ok, I'll update this in v3.

Many thanks for your careful review.
