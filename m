Yes please.

Well let's assume we have drivers/clocksource/timer-dm.c implement
an irq controller. Then the pwm driver would just do:

pwm9: dmtimer-pwm {
	compatible = "ti,omap-dmtimer-pwm";
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
	ti,timers = <&timer9>;
	ti,clock-source = <0x00>; /* timer_sys_ck */
	interrupts-extended = <&timer9 IRQ_TYPE_SOMETHING>;
};

Then you can do whatever you need to in the pwm driver with
enable_irq/disable_irq + a handler?

If reading the line status is needed.. Then maybe the GPIO framework
needs to have hardware timer support instead?

Anyways, just thinking out loud how we could have a Linux generic
hardware timer framework that drivers like pwm could then use.

Tony
