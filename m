Indeed.

IIO has a per-device sysfs file for setting up
the POSIX timestamping named current_timestamp_clock.
This was added by Gregor Boire in commit
bc2b7dab629a

The supported timestamps are:
realtime
monotonic
monotonic_raw
realtime_coarse
monotonic_coarse
boottime
tai

I could really need some help here... :/

It feels like "monotonic" could very well be what you're
looking for but I don't know the POSIX definition of these.
Maybe we need to add one more for "device specific"?

What I want to do is factor most of that commit out into
lib/ and reuse for timestamping in GPIO so we can
have coherent timestamps across GPIO and IIO.

OK OK O need to get to it and stop talking...

I guess it should be set per-gpiochip rather than
per-gpio-desc though, but that makes most sense anyways.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
