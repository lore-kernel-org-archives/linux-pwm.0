The placement of the call suggested that you also need to enable the
clock in order to access any of the registers. In such cases it's often
simpler to take (and release) the reference to the clock irrespective
of the current state.

So the general sequence might look like this:

	/* allow access to registers */
	clk_enable();

	/* modify registers */
	...

	/* enable clock to drive PWM counter */
	if (state->enabled && !cstate.enabled)
		clk_enable();

	/* disable clock to PWM counter */
	if (!state->enabled && cstate.enabled)
		clk_disable();

	/* access to registers no longer needed */
	clk_disable();

This ensures that as long as you keep the "register" reference to the
clock, the clock will remain on.

There is a somewhat tricky situation that could happen if the initial
clock reference count is not in sync. Consider the case where your
->get_state() determines that the PWM is enabled. cstate.enabled would
be true, but the clock enable count would not be incremented. So you'd
have to make sure to add code to the ->get_state() implementation that
calls clk_enable() for each PWM that is enabled.

In my opinion that would be the cleanest option and easiest to follow,
but its more work to properly implement than I initially assumed, so
I'm fine with the version that you have, too.

Okay, looks like we don't need it here, then.

What I find odd about the placement is that it is between the
regmap_write() and the regmap_update_bits(). But it could just as well
be after the regmap_update_bits() (or before regmap_write() for that
matter). So the confusing thing is why it "breaks" the sequence of
register accesses.

>=20

The PWM subsystem doesn't give a guarantee that a live change is
possible. Drivers always have to assume that the PWM may get disabled
and reenabled as part of the sequence.

That said, something like this could be added in the future if users
come along that required this guarantee.

For your driver, I think it's fine to keep this as-is.

In my opinion we should trust DTB in this type of situation. If the DT
binding says that the PWM node needs to be a child of an MFD, then the
author of the DTB needs to make sure it is.

For things that can be easily checked I think it makes sense to validate
the DTB, but this check here is not enough for all situations, right?
What if somebody added the device node as child to some unrelated node.
ddata could be a valid pointer, but pointing at something that's not a
struct stm32_lptimer at all. That's still pretty bad, and completely
undetectable.
