I really appreciate that you do this effort, thanks.

Even if the hardware are named differently in the documentation they
all share the
same registers definitions and mapping but configurations are
different for each device.

4 compatible strings will not be enough to describe devices
configuration, for example
in the documentation general purpose timers could have a 16 or 32 bit
counter, for 1 to 4
pwm channels and triggers (accepted or generated by the device) are
different for each device.

DAC could be drive by timers 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
ADC could be driver by 32 triggers

pwm and trigger share the same registers but not the same bits.
With regmap write functions I don't have sharing problems.

Hardware really share the same registers mapping that why I have wrote
one only driver
per framework. Only the configurations are different
