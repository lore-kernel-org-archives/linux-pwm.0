I do not really understand what driver you are referring to.

If the pin controller node is overarching and spawning children for
the gpiochips, you use the design pattern from MFD to pass data
from parents to children, e.g.:

#include <linux/regmap.h>

pinctrl driver:
     struct regmap_config mapconf =3D {
                .reg_bits =3D 32,
                .val_bits =3D 32,
                .reg_stride =3D 4,
     };
    struct regmap *map;

    map =3D regmap_init_mmio(dev, base, &mapconf);
    if (IS_ERR(map))
          ....
    dev_set_drvdata(dev, map);
    of_populate_children(dev,)..
    (can also use platform_device_add_data() or "simple-bus" etc)

gpio subdrivers:
     struct regmap *map;

     map =3D dev_get_drvdata(dev->parent);

There are examples of drivers passing more complex things to
their children than a regmap, just put some struct in a <linux/*/*.h>
file and pass it with drvdata as per above.

PS i2c_set_drvdata(), platform_set_drvdata() are just aliases
for dev_set_drvdata().
