So I believe this is a question on if we want to hide the minor
delta between AM18 vs AM335x, AM437x and AM57x/DRA7 in the driver
or within the DT.

Note that handling this by defining new clocks in DT will then
result in older DTBs not working. I don't think its worth breaking
backwards compatibility for AM335x and AM437x DTBs for fixing support
for AM18 based SOCs. Especially since those SOCs haven't worked with
this driver for several years. By handling things within the driver rather
than DT we can atleast insure that we can get everything working while
avoiding breaking backwards compatibility.
