Thanks Paul! Although not sure if adding a new compatible for the IP is
the best way (since that would denote a different version of the IP).
How about checking for parent clock iff clk_get() on own device fails
and of_machine_is_compatible() matches the platforms where backward
compatibility needs to be maintained?

Thanks,
Sekhar
