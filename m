I think this needs to be separate patches; at least the new pwm.h should
be introduced separately to the board-specific *.dts edits, and perhaps
further split up?

That way, the one patch that introduces <dt-bindings/pwm.h> would be
available to be merged into any other tree that wanted to take patches
to use the new defines.

Rather than manually editing that to ensure the enum matches the DT
bindings header, the whole point of making a separate <dt-bindings/...>
directory was that drivers could include the binding header files
directly to avoid having to duplicate the constant definitions. Can't
<linux/pwm.h> include <dt-bindings/pwm.h> and remove that enum?
