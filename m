This series consists of various cleanups and improvements for the
pwm-meson driver.

Patches 1 to 6 are small code cleanups with the goal of making the code
easier to read.

Patches 7 to 9 are reworking the way the per-channel settings are
accessed. This is a first preparation step for adding full support to
meson_pwm_get_state() in the pwm-meson driver. Patch 7 makes struct
meson_pwm_channel accessible from struct meson_pwm because
meson_pwm_get_state() cannot use pwm_get_chip_data(). Patch 8 removes
redundant switch/case statements and ensures that we don't have to
add another redundant one for the upcoming full meson_pwm_get_state()
implementation. Patch 9 gets rid of meson_pwm_add_channels() and moves
the pwm_set_chip_data() call to meson_pwm_request() (like all other PWM
drivers do - except two).

Patch 10 is based on a suggestion by Uwe to simplify the calculation of
the values which the PWM IP requires. The nice benefit of this is that
we have an easier calculation which we can do "in reverse" for the
meson_pwm_get_state() (which calculates nanoseconds from the hardware
values).

Patch 11 implements reading the period and duty cycle in the
meson_pwm_get_state() callback.

Patch 12 removes some internal caching which we don't need anymore now
meson_pwm_get_state() is fully implemented. The PWM core now takes care
of not calling pwm_ops.apply() if "nothing has changed".

Patch 13 adds support for PWM_POLARITY_INVERSED when disabling the
output as suggested by Uwe.

Patch 14 completes this series by adding some documentation to the
driver. Thanks to Neil for summarizing how the hardware works
internally.

Due to the changed PWM calculation in patch 10 I have verified that
we don't break any existing boards. The patch itself contains two
examples which show that the new calculation improves precision. I
made screenshots of the measurements in pulseview [0] for the second
case ("PWM LED on Khadas VIM"):
- old algorithm: [1]
- old algorithm: [2]
