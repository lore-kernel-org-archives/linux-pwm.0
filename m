Thanks!

I know there was a lot of discussion on 4, but I'm not sure what the 
concern is on patch 2. Is there something specific you're thinking of?

FYI, I know that Adam Ford is using this driver as the backend for
a pwm-backlight control. Without patch 2 this driver will not configure 
the HW in a legal way at 0 or 100% duty cycle. However, I forget what 
the practical effect of that is, and Adam seemed to indicate it was OK
for his purposes.
