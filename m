What about splitting it in three patches that

- add the include/dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h header, and update include/linux/pwm.h 
and Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt

- update the rest of the documentation

- update the .dts files

We could do that, but we would then need to modify all drivers to replace 
enum_pwm_polarity with unsigned int. Thierry, what's your opinion on this ?

Replying to a comment from another e-mail, I know that the above change to 
include/linux/pwm.h is not strictly needed as the enum values are already 
correct. The point of specifying the enum values explicitly was to hint that 
the values matter and should not be changed. A comment in the source would 
probably be more appropriate though.
