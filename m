Hmm the second option sounds appealing to me as then the device
tree binding really follows the hardware:

bit 2 capture interrupt
bit 1 overflow interrupt
bit 0 match interrupt

and in the dts we can describe these with:

interrupts-extended = <&timer 9 2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_SOMETHING>;
interrupts-extended = <&timer 9 1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_SOMETHING>;
interrupts-extended = <&timer 9 0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_SOMETHING>;

I think these are all edge based on "Capture Mode Functionality"
chapter in the TRM?

Sounds like a bug somehwere, probably in software?

OK seems like having drivers/clocksource/timer-dm.c a chained
interrupt handler should do it :) Anyways, that's a different
set of patches on top of these.
