I'll comment on this in a reply to Stephen.

OK.

Oops :-)

Will fix.

I'll fix that as well. Please see my reply to Stephen for details.

Please see my reply to Stephen as well. I'll at least replace this change with 
a comment, or remove enum pwm_polarity completely if that's the preferred 
solution.
