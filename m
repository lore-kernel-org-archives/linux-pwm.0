Only s390 as far as I know. Most architectures have integrated
peripherals that use MMIO without PCI.

Your assumption is correct.

For tile by itself it would certainly be best to leave this
dependency, it makes no sense to enable IOMEM without PCI.

That doesn't solve the problem of COMPILE_TEST enabling drivers
that require IOMEM though. An easy hack for that would be to
make COMPILE_TEST depend on HAS_IOMEM, but it gets into hacky territory
there, and it's not clear if this is any better than the original patch
to provide fallbacks for ioremap and friends. Definitely simpler
though.
