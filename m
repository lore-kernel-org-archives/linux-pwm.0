Sorry from a hwmod perspective your right. I initially
thought my response about the clocks were related to hwmod
but I see why I was off after reading a bit more on hwmod.

Your right my response did miss your initial point. But what
I'm proposing sounds like exactly what you were suggesting.
I think we both agree that hwmod entries for ePWM, eCAP and
eQEP should be removed. Not just for dra7 but also for
am335x and am437x as separate patches.

My comment about devm_clk_get was based on the fact that I
don't believe eCAP, ePWM and eQEP should have their own
clock defined even within DT. Instead they can just
reference the clk provided by pwmss (its parent) which in
hardware is the clock that is directly passed to the
sub-devices. The only reason those drivers need a reference
to that clk is to get its rate once during probe.

I plan on doing a bit more testing and I can shoot an
updated v4. I believe it will address all of your comments
and you will hopefully get a better understanding of the
minor change I plan on making.

As you mentioned pwmss is the parent node in the DT while
ecap and epwm are child nodes. These child nodes must be
probed only after their parent node has been probed and the
parent clock is running. The pwm-tipwmss.c already calls
of_platform_populate(node, NULL, NULL, &pdev->dev); as the
very last step of its probe call. So what you want to happen
is already happening in the driver. So I don't believe
simple-bus is needed.
