So this assumes that eCAP and eHRPWM are always under the PWMSS
umbrella. But on TI AM18x, thats not true. These IPs exist independently
and receive functional clock from PLL sysclk outputs.

Even keeping the AM18x usecase aside, this seems to be pushing too much
platform information into the driver. The "fck" is a valid connection id
for the eCAP IP. Whether its valid for the parent device too is not
something this driver should need to know.

So it looks like what you need is for the clock hierarchy for the
platform to have clocks for eHRPWM and eCAP derived out of PWMSS clock?

Thanks,
