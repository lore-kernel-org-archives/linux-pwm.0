The series,
Reviewed-by: Stephen Warren <swarren@nvidia.com>

I'm (very very) slightly hesitant about patch 3/4, since it's moving
towards all PWMs having to use the same specifier format, whereas
specifiers are at least potentially binding-specific, not
device-type-specific. However, consistency is good; there's no need to
do something different just for the heck of it. Equally, there's nothing
actually stopping a new binding from defining its own format rather than
simply deferring to pwm.txt if it absolutely has to, so I think this
will turn out fine.
