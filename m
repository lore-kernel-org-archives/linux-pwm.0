The clock diagram indeed doesn't have PERW_BUS clocks, while the clock
list does have both, and the main document refers to them as clock
supplies for e.g. (H)SCIF and I2C.  Sole exception is LBCK_PERW_MAIN,
which is in the diagram, but not in the list; the latter has
LBCK_PERW_BUS.

Note that S0ASYNCD8_PERW_{BUS,MAIN} is even listed twice, with different
divider chains, but still resulting in the same final rate.

For e.g. VIO, _MAIN in the clock diagram and _BUS in the clock list
indeed seem to be synonyms.

In DT, we only model supplies and consumers, so only tail clocks from
the diagrams (i.e. what's in the lists)?

At least the FCK input.

E.g. DIV6 dividers (like the MSIOF parent) do have clock gating.

Bad...

Agreed.

So DP_EXT_VIO_DP[012] are/can be modeled as the same clock?

That is really bad.

Are the DP_EXT_VIO_DP[012] clocks functional clock parents?
If yes, the MDLC remapping driver can work around this by always
controlling all three together when module standby is controlled.
If no, the CPG remapping driver probably has to return a new clock
type that controls all three together.

It is indeed tempting, and would match what we did for previous
R-Car SoCs.  Having unused definitions is not that bad, it might just
increase a linear table used in an xlate function (which we currently
don't have in the CPG driver).
