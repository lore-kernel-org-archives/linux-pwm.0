I removed all PM runtime calls that revolved around
pwmss_submodule_state_change. Originally the driver would do
a pm_runtime_get_sync then call pwmss_submodule_state_change
and then immediately call pm_runtime_put_sync. Without
pwmss_submodule_state_change those calls would be
meaningless.  I also removed pm_runtime calls in error paths
that no longer existed.

Within ecap and epwm driver pm_runtime_get is done when
pwm_enable is called  and pm_runtime_sync calls are done
when pwm_disable is called. Similar pm_runtime_get and
pm_runtime_sync calls are done in functions that ended up
touching register's within the IP.
