So the clocks should be unlocked when ever the IP registers are
being read/written or if the peripheral is being used for
example
the pwm signal is being generated. All these cases are already
being handled.

Using ecap driver as an example.

Pm_runtime_get_sync is called within ecap_pwm_enable when
the pwm signal is to be generated. Pm_runtime_put_sync is called
when the pwm signal is to be stopped.

When either the pwm signal polarity is set or pwm
configuration is made
then a pm_runtime_get_sync and pm_runtime_put_sync are
called within
the same function surrounding calls to the IP's registers.

Probe is calling pm_runtime_enable while remove is calling
pm_runtime_disable.

So the correct pm_runtime calls are being made from what I
can see.
I'm not sure I understand the concern since removing those
calls aren't
creating any kind of imbalance.

If I'm not addressing your concern please give me an example
of where
you see a possible issue.

I've tested these changes on AM335x GP and AM437x GP evms.
AM335x
and AM437x were the only other users of this driver. Sorry 
I should of
documented this in my cover-letter.
