Pwm-tipwmss.c exports a function
pwmss_submodule_state_change which interacts with
PWMSS_CLKCONFIG and PWMSS_CLKSTATUS registers. Both
pwm-tiehrpwm.c and pwm-tiecap.c calls this exported function
to unlock the gate at probe time and lock the gate when the
driver is removed.

So when the gate fails to be unlocked after it previously is
locked there isn't a way to know this via the
PWMSS_CLKSTATUS registers. So the driver "believes" that the
gate is unlocked and when pwm_bl runs it calls the
set_polarity function. Set_polarity in the case of AM437x gp
evm maps to the ecap's  ecap_pwm_set_polarity function call.
This call then attempts to write to the ecap registers which
results in the external abort since the clock to the ecap is
still gated.

When the ecap and tihrpwm driver request to unlock the clock
gate it already checks the XXX_CLK_EN_ACK bitfields within
CLKSTATUS and it shows that the clocks "should" be unlocked.
So there is an issue with the IP.

Yes, I plan on addressing the change Vignesh acknowledged
regarding changing RESETSTATUS to SOFTRESET. For your other
comments I believe he already explained why it has to be set
in that particular way. If there is anything that I missed
or something that isn't clear please let me know.
