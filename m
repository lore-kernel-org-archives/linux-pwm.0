So the AM335x, AM437x  and DA850 all use ehrpwm0:
ehrpwm@<address>. Also the address of 0 simply follows the
pattern used in the other binding examples in that doc. I
can replace the 0 address in this patch and make another
patch that fixes it for the other examples in that file. But
in terms of switching from ehrpwm0:ehrpwm@<address> to
ehrpwm0:pwm@<address> that would also require making changes
to the various dtsis also. So is it worth making that
change? If so I have no problem doing it.
