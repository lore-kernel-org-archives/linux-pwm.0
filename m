We don't need to describe the state machine because is done inside
the hardware block. We need to tell to the hardware on which edge(s)
it had to count and the number of lines, with that it will give you the
counter value and the direction.

I do believe that describe active edges per lines is a good and generic
way to configure counters and quadrature encoders
