My point was more about the fact that though the naming appears to (and kind
of does describe an index) these devices are really as different as for example
different part numbers would imply on a range of ADCs (say the multitude supported
by the max1363 driver - all of which are very nearly register compatible)

Hence I'd be less quick to dismiss the option of a number of compatible strings
rather than the wealth of description you'll otherwise have to put in the device
tree.

One driver is fine, but the difference to my mind are sufficient that
we may need to use compatible strings for the various options.  Worth
a go at trying to fully describe them first though!
