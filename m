Thanks to you (and everyone else involved) for doing the heavy lifting 
on the driver to begin with. It came just as I had a need for the PWM 
output of a dmtimer, and came to the conclusion that just such a
timer-to-PWM adapter was needed.

For what its worth, I took a quick look at the Pandaboard Rev EA1 
schematic, and I can see how it doesn't make using a timer PWM output 
easy. Easiest option I found might be to change the pinmux for AG24 
(h_GPIO_121) to be DMTIMER11_PWM_EVT, and probe it at S2 or J13.
