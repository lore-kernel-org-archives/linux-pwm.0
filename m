It would be great, if you could add those above to your serie.

This one is independent of your serie, just "[PATCH 2/2] clocksource:
timer-dm: Check prescaler value" makes it a bit more error prone,
but there is no compile nor runtime dependency.

Perhaps it could me merged directly via pwm tree after some review?

I have few more patches to add event capture support, based on top
of those already sent, which I'll send separately.
