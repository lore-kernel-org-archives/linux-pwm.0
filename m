Tony,

Only function that i could push out of dmtimer.h was
__omap_dm_timer_override_errata

which is being currently called by mach-omap2/timer.c alone.

Rest all are used both my dmtimer.c as well as mach-omap2/timer.c.
Here is the list:

__omap_dm_timer_read
__omap_dm_timer_write
__omap_dm_timer_init_regs
__omap_dm_timer_enable_posted
__omap_dm_timer_stop
__omap_dm_timer_load_start
__omap_dm_timer_int_enable
__omap_dm_timer_read_counter
__omap_dm_timer_write_status

Any preferences on moving them to dmtimer.c or leaving them in header file?

Regards,
Keerthy
