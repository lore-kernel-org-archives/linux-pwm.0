Thanks a bunch! :-). I will take the pwm driver fix along with mine.

should i also take the two patches which you sent:

[PATCH 1/2] clocksource: timer-dm: Make unexported functions static
[PATCH 2/2] clocksource: timer-dm: Check prescaler value

Also what about this:
[PATCH] pwm: omap-dmtimer: Fix frequency when using prescaler

Let me know. I plan to send v6 with your Tested-by.

Thanks,
Keerthy

Yes! Thanks for your feedback.
