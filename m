I agree with the reasoning, so I'll implement the patch split scheme described 
above unless someone objects.

If ACPI (or any other source of device information) uses different numerical 
values for the flags we will need an xlate function. In the DT case we're 
designing bindings so we're free to pick the numerical values currently used 
by the kernel, and even use the same symbolic names. I'm however fine with 
renamed the #define's in dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h. Does anyone have a preference 
regarding the names I should use ?
