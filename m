Well, if the comments I made on the patch re: that <linux/pwm.h>
should simply #include <dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h> instead of duplicating
the constants, then yet this patch will solve that. There will be a
single place where the constants are defined.

If that's all the happens, then there will still be duplication
between pwm.txt and <linux/pwm.h>.

Yes, the separate repository would obviously require a version of dtc
that's able to compile the files there; i.e. a version equivalent to
what's already in the kernel tree (upstream 1.4.0 specifically).

Again, right now, all of the binding docs, the *.dts files, and the
dtc required to use them are part of the kernel; a single package, so
there's no scope for issues re: using dtc features that aren't
supported. If those components get separated later, obviously there
will be a requirement to install a specific version of dtc to use with
the separated *.dts and binding files.
