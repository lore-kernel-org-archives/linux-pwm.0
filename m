I did timing tests for both a long time back but I doubt things have
changed much.  To do fusion you ideally smooth the result on the basis
you are fairly sure the internal clock is better than even then jitter
we get in an interrupt.

No idea where the absolute numbers went though I'm afraid.
Perhaps Gregor can provide more info?

Not sure who else is doing sensor fusion currently...
