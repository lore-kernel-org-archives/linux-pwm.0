Shouldn't all system-wide flags be supported by all HW, perhaps being
implemented by the core subsystem rather than individual drivers to
ensure that? Consider the case of the GPIO active-low flag which is
actually implemented in SW, hence can work with any GPIO controller.

Perhaps that's not possible in all cases, in which case, yes, it does
make sense to define which of the common flags a particular HW module
supports.

But then there's a problem where people assume that the common flags are
always available, and somewhere they aren't... Care is needed in the
choice of which common flags to define and/or how they're used.
