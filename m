I believe exposing some sort of time data has merit. Quadrature counter
devices in particular are commonly used for position tracking of
automation systems, and such systems would benefit from velocity/speed
information. So let's try to introduce that sort of functionality in this
driver if possible.

First, let's discuss your specific use case and requirements, and hopefully we
can generalize it enough to be of use for future drivers. From your description,
it sounds like you're attaching some sort of rotary encoder to the eQEP device.
Is that correct? What sort of time data are you hoping to use; does the eQEP
device provide a clock value, or would you be grabbing a timestamp from the
system?

I'm not sure yet if it would make sense to expose rotational speed directly as
an attribute. If we were to expose just the count value and timestamp since the
last read, that should be enough for a user to compute the delta and derive
speed. I'll think more about this since some devices may simplify that case if
the hardware is able to compute the speed for us.
