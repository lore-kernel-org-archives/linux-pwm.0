As explained in another reply, this would require replacing the enum with an 
unsigned int. I can write a patch if we agree on this.

I've explicitly mentioned the flags in individual DT bindings to ease adding 
new flags in the future. At the moment the defined flags are either all 
supported or not used at all by drivers. If we later add a new flag supported 
by a subset of drivers only the driver bindings should list supported flags 
for each driver.

I'm fine with removing the explicit mentions of individual flags right now and 
adding it back when needed if you think that's better.
