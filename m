OK Cool.

Thierry, can you please take a look at the driver code and see if
you want other clean-ups done before moving this to drivers?

For merging, I can set up an immutable branch for this against
v4.15-rc1 when it's out and no more comments. That way we both
can then merge it in as needed.

Regards,

Tony
