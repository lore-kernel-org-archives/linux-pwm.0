This series adds device tree bindings and a new counter driver for the Texas
Instruments Enhanced Quadrature Encoder Pulse (eQEP).

As mentioned in one of the commit messages, to start with, the driver only
supports reading the current counter value and setting the min/max values.
Other features can be added as the counter subsystem gains support for them.

v3 changes:
- Minor changes to device tree bindings (style and generic node name)
- Drop action in initializer
- Fix ordering of pm runtime disable
v2 changes:
- New patch to move TI PWMSS driver from drivers/pwm/ to drivers/bus/
- Device tree bindings converted to .yaml format
- Device tree clock renamed from "fck" to "sysclkout"
- Dropped unused index and strobe signals from counter driver
- Added synapses and actions to counter driver
- Fixed base in of kstrtouint()
- Clarifications in commit messages

This series has been tested on a BeagleBone Blue with the following script:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

from os import path
from time import sleep

COUNTER_PATH = '/sys/bus/counter/devices'
COUNTERS = ['counter0', 'counter1', 'counter2']
COUNT0 = 'count0'
COUNT = 'count'
FUNCTION = 'function'
CEILING = 'ceiling'
FLOOR = 'floor'
ENABLE = 'enable'

cnts = []

for c in COUNTERS:
    function_path = path.join(COUNTER_PATH, c, COUNT0, FUNCTION)
    with open(function_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write('quadrature x4')
    floor_path = path.join(COUNTER_PATH, c, COUNT0, FLOOR)
    with open(floor_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(0))
    ceiling_path = path.join(COUNTER_PATH, c, COUNT0, CEILING)
    with open(ceiling_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(0xffffffff))
    enable_path = path.join(COUNTER_PATH, c, COUNT0, ENABLE)
    with open(enable_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write('1')

    cnt_path = path.join(COUNTER_PATH, c, COUNT0, COUNT)
    cnts.append(open(cnt_path, 'r'))

while True:
    for c in cnts:
        c.seek(0)
        val = int(c.read())
        if val >= 0x80000000:
            val -= 0x100000000
        print(val, end=' ')
    print()
    sleep(1)
