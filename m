Why does the driver have to move? There is certainly some precedent for
having arch-specific code in arch/ but expose the public API via some
header in include/linux. Sometimes there's just no proper place for the
driver elsewhere, so rather than moving it somewhere more or less random
keeping it in arch/arm/plat-omap is just as good.
