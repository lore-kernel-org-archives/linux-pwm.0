Makes sense.

I did notice that no (in-tree) drivers were currently using

From a userspace ABI point of view, I was unsure whether it was 
considered OK for a R/W sysfs attribute of this nature to read back 
differently than it was set. To follow the previous example:
	# echo 100000 > period
	# cat period
        122070
I didn't find any obvious precedents for that. Would it potentially 
confuse userspace? Is the answer different for new drivers vs 
existing ones? The obvious alternative would be a separate file (e.g. 
"actual_period", or somesuch name), which avoids those questions, but 
I can see how that could be considered less clean. I don't have any 
preference either way.

If just updating the existing period/duty_cycle files with the
actual values is the way to go, then there is a second question:
should the struct pwm_device track both requested and actual 
values in separate fields for kernel-internal users? Or should
the existing period/duty_cycle fields just be modified to hold
the actual values?

Either way, I think any changes along these lines would probably be 
cleaner ontop of the atomic update work (assuming some form of that 
gets merged). And since it would also be outside the scope of this 
patchset, you may still want to consider the simple debug message 
in this patch as at least an interim state.
