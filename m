We don't have a driver for eQEP which is why there is no DT
entry for it. For eCAP, the original patch series didn't
include the eCAP DT nodes and I never verified why this is
the case. In our TI tree we have eCAP0 only in the DT. The
TRM doesn't state that eCAP0-2 are unsupported so there
should be entries for all 3 eCAPs.

For AM335x and AM437x, eCAP nodes are already under the
ePWMSS nodes.
