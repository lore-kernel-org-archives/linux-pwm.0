I disagree here. The whole point of creating header files for the
constants in binding definitions was so that you wouldn't have to
duplicate all the values into the binding definitions. Rather, you'd
simply say "see <dt-bindings/xxx.h>".

A comment on the original patch:

You're creating <dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h>. That filename sounds entirely
generic, as if the values are defining something PWM-wide rather than
specific to individual PWM bindings. As such, I think the text in each
individual binding should simply say something like:

-----
the third cell encodes standard PWM flags, as defined in
<dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h>.
-----

Similarly, pwm.txt should mention that standard flags exist, and refer
to that same file for definitions.

It's pretty trivial to find the header that defines the values; just
grab the latest source. If you're looking at an old version of the
.dts file, it's almost certain that's within the context of an old
Linux kernel soruce tree, in which case you trivially have access to
the old version of the binding document that spelled out the values.

It would have to. That separate repository would be upstream for
<dt-bindings/> files, which would be imported into the kernel
periodically as drivers wanted to make use of any new headers/values
defined there.

The dtc source tree is duplicated into the kernel source tree, so that
isn't an issue for now.

Besides, the dtc version is an entirely unrelated issue to how the
documentation is written.

I wondered about that too. It's slightly indirect in that you'd read
foo-pwm.txt which would say something like:

-----
the third cell encodes standard PWM flags, as defined by the core PWM
binding in pwm.txt in this directory.
-----

and pwm.txt would say:

-----
The PWM specifier should include a flags cell to contain standard PWM
flags. Values for that cell are defined in <dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.h>.
-----

Which is somewhat like following a lot of symlinks. Still, I agree
that's arguably the correct thing to do.
