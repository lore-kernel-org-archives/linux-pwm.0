Sorry it took so long to test this, I had some construction at my
house so I was without a computer for a few days, then I put it on the
market and some showings, so I wasn't allowed to be home much over the
weekend.

I have finally tested this today.  Applying all 4 patches appears have
no negative impact on what I'm doing.  The perceived brightness
appears to work just fine, but I am not using an oscilloscope, so I
can't see the exact duty cycle or frequency.
