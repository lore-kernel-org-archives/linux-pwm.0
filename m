I'm satisfied with this version of the patchset.

Jonathan, if you have no objections please pick up this up so that it
can make it to the 5.4 merge window coming in soon. Alternatively, I can
merge it into my repository instead and hold it for a while longer
there, if you prefer that route.

Thank you,

William Breathitt Gray
