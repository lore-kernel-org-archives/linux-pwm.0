Well, possibly. But that's not the idea of the feature. The idea is to
synchronize time. Say you program GPIO to fire at every 1 ms, a remote
processor/accelerator/etc can synchronize its own time to this 1 ms
tick.

That's at least my understanding.

Sure, however the same feature is also used for timestampped input :-)

Say another processor is the one asserting a GPIO every 1 ms. I can
sample it as quickly as possible, but we're bound to face SW
overhead. When the timestamp is latched, then the overhead can be
accounted for.

this is running as a thread with interrupts enabled, AFAICT. This means
this thread can be preempted at least on PREEMPT_RT kernels, so your
timestamp can be wrong, right?

yes, it's done by a high resolution timer

I see... I wonder if the SW timestamping is suffcient here. Has anybody
done any sort of jitter analysis with heavy loaded CPU for this feature?
