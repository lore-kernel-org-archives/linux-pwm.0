Reworked the change pushed upstream earlier [1] so as to not add an extension
to an obsolete API. With this change, pwm_ops->apply() can be used to set
pwm_state parameters as usual.

Changes from v1:
  - Fixed compilation errors seen when compiling for different archs.

Changes from v2:
  - Fixed %u -> %llu in a dev_dbg in pwm-stm32-lp.c, thanks to kbuild test robot
  - Added a couple of fixes to pwm-imx-tpm.c and pwm-sifive.c

Changes from v3:
  - Rebased to current tip of for-next.

Changes from v4:
  - Split the patch into two: one for changes to the drivers, and the actual
    switch to u64 for ease of reverting should the need arise.
  - Re-examined the patch and made the following corrections:
      * intel_panel.c:
	DIV64_U64_ROUND_UP -> DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL (as only the numerator would be
	64-bit in this case).
      * pwm-sti.c:
	do_div -> div_u64 (do_div is optimized only for x86 architectures, and
	div_u64's comment block suggests to use this as much as possible).

  pwm: Convert drivers to use 64-bit period and duty cycle
  pwm: core: Convert period and duty cycle to u64
