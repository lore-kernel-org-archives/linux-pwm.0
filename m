I think it would make sense to merge it through the MIPS tree, yes,
considering that the patches for the drivers in the other subsystems are
quite small, and that they just remove code (well, except the pinctrl
driver itself). Besides, the files modified are not touched very often
so the chances of breakage are pretty low.
