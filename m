No, it not related to HSPCLKDIV. The TRM wrongly states L4PER2_L3_GICLK
as clock input for PWMSS. But actually  L4PER2_L4_GICLK(=L3_GICLK/2) is
the clock input for PWMSS. This will be updated in TRM soon.

sorry my bad... I will change this in v3.

Since, this register is within the config space of PWMSS, the individual
gating and reporting for the modules within PWMSS
(PWMSS_CLKCONFIG) is currently being taken care by pwm-tipwmss.c(almost
the sole function this driver is doing). It has been the same since
am335x. Adding new clock nodes will result in driver changes and also
changes to am335x, am437x (and other platforms) hwmod files. It also
involves adding new nodes to clocks.dtsi and it will be difficult to
maintain backward compatibility for older platforms. Is it not better to
keep this as is, in order to maintain consistency (with am335x, am437x
etc) and also that these clock bits are within IP's config space?
