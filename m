But what do you gain from that? All drivers that need these
functions should already 'depends on HAS_IOMEM' and if they don't,
we should fix /that/ instead. I don't see this dependency as any
different from a lot of others (PCI, DMAENGINE, HAVE_CLK, ...)
that we use to intentionally annotate drivers that need a particular
feature to be present for compilation. Do you want to do the
same hack to those?

Ok. Would you mind sending a patch that enables HAS_IOMEM on
score?

That is a fair goal, but it seems better to do that by ensuring
we don't build any code that tries to call the MMIO functions
rather than trying to make them build.
