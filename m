I added Sekhar to hopefully comment if it would be better to
try to get the reg properties to use their physical
addresses or change the unit address to use the offset values.

I don't mind shooting a patch that makes this massive switch
for all the various peripherals and documentation. However,
this is a bit beyond this series.  In this series I am not
setting the unit address or reg address I am simply
documenting what is currently being used. This patch set is
a dependency for another patchset to get PWM support for DRA7.

Are you ok with me doing the below?
I submit a v2 that removes the leading 0 in this patch. This
way this patchset and my PWMSS support for DRA7 patchset can
get merged. I can then follow up with another separate
patchset that insures both the unit address and the value in
the reg property are aligned.
