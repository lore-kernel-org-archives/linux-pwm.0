I need to know if I have to activate breakinput feature and on which level
I will rewrite it like that:
Optional parameters:
- st,breakinput-polarity-high: Set if break input polarity is active
on high level.
- st,breakinput-polarity-high: Set if break input polarity is active
on low level.

I found a way to detect, at probe time, the number of channels, counter size,
break input capability and complementary channels so I will remove
"st,breakinput", "st,32bits-counter", "st,complementary" and "st,pwm-num-chan"
parameters
