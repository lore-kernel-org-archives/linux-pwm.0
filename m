The canonical form to write this these days is:

- #pwm-cells: Should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description =
of
  the cells format.

I don't think dashes work in labels or phandles. They do work in node
names, though, so this could be:

	pwm_pins: pinmux-pwm-pins {
		...
	};

This doesn't seem to be properly ordered now. I suspect that back when
you posted that last time PCA9685 support hadn't been merged yet and the
rebase messed this up.

I wonder: does the OMAP not have dedicated PWM hardware?

Same ordering issue here.

I'd prefer these to be sorted alphabetically.

These should no longer be necessary. polarity, duty_ns and period_ns are
available in struct pwm_device nowadays.

Nit: If you sort the chip field first, then the to_omap_chip() below
essentially becomes a no-op.

This should be a static inline function for type checking.

Nit: perhaps rename ns to period to make the purpose clearer?

This condition easily fits on a single line.

I'd prefer this to be split up into getting a struct clk * and then
querying that.

I prefer these not to be aligned at all. It doesn't add to the
readability and makes a mess when a new function is added with a name
longer than "set_polarity".

There's a spurious blank line here.

For consistency with the remainder of this driver I'd prefer this to be:

Can there ever be another failure? Perhaps an invalid timer_id? I
suppose that if the omap_dm_timer API can't provide more details this is
as good as it gets. Ideally omap_dm_timer_request_specific() would
return an ERR_PTR()-encoded error code which you could then simply
propagate.

Move what "to the configure method"? There's nothing here that could be
moved.

I don't think you necessarily need this temporary variable. You only use
it twice. If you make the change I propose a little further down, you'll
only reference it once so keeping it around isn't useful.

Could use a blank line to separate the above two. Although with the
change proposed below the if (!np) check can actually go away.

Could use another blank line to separate the above two lines. Again it
would be nicer if omap_dm_timer_request_by_node() returned some kind of
precise error. Unless there really are no errors other than the device
not being there yet (therefore assuming deferred probe will eventually
succeed).

There should be no need to initialize this.

We don't need an error message here.

I'd like to propose that this be rewritten as:

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF) && dev->of_node)
		status =3D omap_pwm_from_dt(omap, dev);

The reason is that you can now simply drop the #ifdeffery around the
function's implementation, remove the dummy and have the compiler
automatically discard the function for !OF. That gives you compile
coverage for free.

Perhaps call pwmchip_remove() last so that omap_dm_timer_free() is
always called, even if pwmchip_remove() fails?

That way you can also make it somewhat shorter using:

	return pwmchip_remove(&omap->chip);

I think this will need #ifdef protection, otherwise the usage of
of_match_ptr() below will make this static and unused.

=2Eowner no longer needs to be assigned, since the core takes care of that
nowadays.

The alignment here is also not necessary. Note how .name and .owner have
been aligned with tabs, but then .of_match_table messes it all up by
being so long. Better not artificially align at all.

More needless alignment.
