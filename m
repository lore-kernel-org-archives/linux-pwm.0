But that's not something that this patch solves. And it could be solved
even in the absence of the header file defining the symbolic constants.
If all the standard flags that dt-bindings/pwm/pwm.txt now specifies
were to be listed in pwm.txt (they actually are) then referring to that
document as the canonical source works equally well.

If we can take both of the above for granted, then sure, let's refer to
the header from within the generic pwm.txt file and add a reference to
that in bindings for drivers that use the standard flags.

Well, not really. If the documentation specifies the binding in a way
that the DTC can't handle that's still a problem. People will end up
with a DTS that their DTC can't compile. I guess that can be resolved
by adding a note to the upstream device tree repository about the
minimum required version of DTC.

Yes, I like this a whole lot better than the current situation. It gets
us almost automatic consistency, which is harder to do with the current
approach.
