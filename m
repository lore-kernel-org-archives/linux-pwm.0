Hi Paul,

Sorry for bringing up this old thread again.

I am working on updating this patchset on behalf of Vignesh
based on your suggestion. During the process of converting
the pwm-tipwmss.c to be a clock provider I discovered that
there is an issue with the PWMSS local clock gates. For
example on AM437x if you run the below commands you will get
a " Custom Error: MASTER M2 (64-bit) TARGET L4_PER_0 (Read):
Data Access in User mode during Functional access" error.

rmmod pwm_tiecap
rmmod pwm_bl
rmmod pwm_tiecap
modprobe pwm_tiecap
modprobe pwm_bl

Full Log: http://pastebin.com/sEyy52HV

On device powerup, the various PWMSS local clock gates are
"unlocked". The remove call in the ecap driver gates the
local PWMSS clock gate for the ecap. The probe of the ecap
driver "unlocks" the clock gate for the ecap. However, once
you try to access any of the ecap registers which is
indirectly accessed by the pwm_bl driver you will get an
error. This is because the ecap clock is still being gated.

This has been verified by hardware folks on our side. Its
been determined these registers are not needed since they
were designed for devices that didn't have a PRCM.
Therefore, the current plan is to update the trms of
AM335x,AM437x,DRA7 and AM57x to make it clear that these
registers shouldn't be touched.

I plan on sending a patch for the pwm-tipwmss.c driver
essentially removing anything that touches the
PWMSS_CLKCONFIG and PWMSS_CLKSTATUS registers. I will also
be sending a v3 version of this patch since I believe the
struct omap_hwmod dra7xx_ecap0_hwmod and similar entries you
had comments about before are ok to leave as is based on the
above findings.
