I feel I might have come across as a bit harsh in the previous review of the
patches leading up to this one. In that case I'm sorry.

I can clearly see that the intent of the series is to remove this hopelessly
idiomatic code from the MIPS hurdle, and move these systems over
to standard frameworks.

In a way, if I look at the kernel as a whole, it would likely look better
after these patches were merged, than before. Even with the
shortcomings I painted out in the previous review comments.

A very complicated piece of messy code is cut from MIPS.

I think this is very valuable work and well worth persuing, so please
go ahead and work with the series, your effort is very much appreciated!

Yours,
Linus Walleij
