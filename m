Still catching up on a lot of email, so I haven't gone through the
entire series. But I don't think the above is true.

My understanding is that you can have separate pin groups for each
pin (provided the hardware supports that) and then control each of
these groups dynamically at runtime.

That is you could have the PWM driver's ->request() and ->free()
call into the pinctrl framework to select the correct pinmux
configuration as necessary.

That could probably work. From only looking at the JZ4740 PWM driver
there's no separate IP block to deal with the PWM outputs, but they are
merely GPIOs controller via a timer, so one instance per GPIO seems like
a fine solution to me.

Typically all of the pinmux is pre-determined by the board design. That
is if you've got 8 pins that can be driven by a PWM signal, not all of
those might be exposed by the design. If, say, only 0-4 and 6 expose the
PWM signal while 5 and 7 expose a different function then you can simply
use a static pinmux configuration and ignore PWMs 5 and 7. Even if
someone were to configure them, the signal would simply go nowhere.

Of course you'd have to check that your hardware actually matches those
assumptions. They certainly apply to many SoCs that I've come across.
