meson_pwm_apply() has to consider the PWM polarity when disabling the
output.
With enabled=false and polarity=PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL the output needs to
be LOW. The driver already supports this.
With enabled=false and polarity=PWM_POLARITY_INVERSED the output needs
to be HIGH. Implement this in the driver by internally enabling the
output with the same settings that we already use for "period == duty".

This fixes a PWM API violation which expects that the driver honors the
polarity also for enabled=false. Due to the IP block not supporting this
natively we only get "an as close as possible" to 100% HIGH signal (in
my test setup with input clock of 24MHz and measuring the output with a
logic analyzer at 24MHz sampling rate I got a duty cycle of 99.998475%
on a Khadas VIM).
