There's actually been some developments regarding the dmtimer usage after
these comments, see below.

Basically we don't want to export custom functions as we've seen what kind
of mess exporting custom interfaces makes. See the current state of omap
DMA for example.

We've figured out a way to access the timers by doing a request_irq()
on a timer, then do a clk_set_rate() to select the timer source clock.

And then we need only about five custom functions to program the timer,
which can be eventually replaced with some Linux generic hardware timer
framework.

For more info, see the discussion in thread "[PATCH 6/8] devicetree: doc:
Document ti,timer-parent property".

Tony
